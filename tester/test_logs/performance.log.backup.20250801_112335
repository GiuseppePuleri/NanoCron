=== nanoCron vs System Cron Performance Test Results (PARSING ONLY - FAIR COMPARISON) ===
Version: 3.0 - Parsing Only Fair Comparison
Date: Fri Aug  1 11:21:15 CEST 2025
System: Linux GIUSEPPE-TAB 6.6.87.2-microsoft-standard-WSL2 #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Thu Jun  5 18:30:46 UTC 2025 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

=== FAIR COMPARISON METHODOLOGY ===
1. IDENTICAL WORKLOADS: Both tests parse exactly 10 jobs
2. PARSING ONLY: No system interactions, no file operations beyond parsing
3. EQUIVALENT DATA: JSON jobs converted to equivalent crontab format
4. UNIFIED MEASUREMENT: Both use /proc/self/status and clock()
5. SAME PROCESSING: Both perform identical validation and simulation steps
6. SAME ENVIRONMENT: Both run in dedicated processes with same monitoring

========================================
=== FAIR COMPARISON ANALYSIS (PARSING ONLY) ===
========================================

=== FAIR TEST VALIDITY ASSESSMENT ===
Methodology: PARSING ONLY (Both tests perform equivalent operations)
Workload Equivalence: 10 jobs each, same commands, same schedule patterns
Memory Measurement: /proc/self/status VmRSS for both tests
CPU Measurement: clock() current process for both tests
Processing Simulation: Identical validation and conversion steps
Test Fairness: EXCELLENT - truly equivalent operations
