=== nanoCron vs System Cron Performance Test Results (UNIFIED METHODOLOGY) ===
Version: 2.0 - Fixed Methodology Issues
Date: Fri Aug  1 00:20:27 CEST 2025
System: Linux GIUSEPPE-TAB 6.6.87.2-microsoft-standard-WSL2 #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Thu Jun  5 18:30:46 UTC 2025 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

=== METHODOLOGY IMPROVEMENTS ===
1. UNIFIED MEMORY MEASUREMENT: Both tests now use /proc/self/status
2. UNIFIED CPU MEASUREMENT: Both tests use clock() for current process
3. COMPARABLE WORKLOADS: Both tests perform similar parsing operations
4. VALIDITY METRICS: Added metadata to assess test quality
5. ABSOLUTE VALUES: Now reporting both delta and absolute memory values
