=== nanoCron vs System Cron Performance Test Results (PARSING ONLY - FAIR COMPARISON) ===
Version: 3.0 - Parsing Only Fair Comparison
Date: Fri Aug  1 12:21:48 CEST 2025
System: Linux GIUSEPPE-TAB 6.6.87.2-microsoft-standard-WSL2 #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Thu Jun  5 18:30:46 UTC 2025 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

=== FAIR COMPARISON METHODOLOGY ===
1. IDENTICAL WORKLOADS: Both tests parse exactly 10 jobs
2. PARSING ONLY: No system interactions, no file operations beyond parsing
3. EQUIVALENT DATA: JSON jobs converted to equivalent crontab format
4. UNIFIED MEASUREMENT: Both use /proc/self/status and clock()
5. SAME PROCESSING: Both perform identical validation and simulation steps
6. SAME ENVIRONMENT: Both run in dedicated processes with same monitoring
